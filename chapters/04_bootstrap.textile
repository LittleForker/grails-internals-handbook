Let's see what happens under the hood when an existing Grails application is run in the dev-mode i.e. the command @grails run-app@ is invoked at the command line. We will start looking at the point where @org.codehaus.groovy.grails.cli.GrailsScriptRunner@ invokes @$GRAILS_SRC_HOME/grails/scripts/RunApp.groovy@ via @gant.Gant#processTargets@ of the loaded script e.g. invokes script's default target.

Here's what the @RunApp.groovy@ looks like:

<pre>
<code>
	includeTargets << grailsScript("_GrailsRun")

	target('default': "Runs a Grails application in Jetty") {
	    depends(checkVersion, configureProxy, packageApp, parseArguments)
	    if(argsMap.https) {
	        runAppHttps()
	    }
	    else {
	        runApp()
	    }
	    watchContext()
	}
</code>
</pre>

As you could see it is a high level Gant script that relies on the lower level targets of the 'system' scripts (the one prefixed with underscore). Let's bisect those targets one by one i.e. @checkVersion@, @configureProxy@, @packageApp@, @parseArgumnets@, @runApp@, and @watchContext@

TODO: Would need some help on this one, as scripts are highly dynamic and it's hard to track where the stuff (variables) comes from. Work in progress...
