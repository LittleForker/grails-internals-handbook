h1. Start.

Grails framework is super cool. It is fairly well documented, but there is a void in its internal implementation documentation (at least more or less a comprehensive one)
Hense the idea for this community-driven book about Grails internals.

h2. What will be covered

* Grails architecture high level overview
* Grails core
* Grails artefacts (artifacts) abstraction
* Grails URL mapping and routing framework
* Grails persistence framework, namely GORM
* Grails MVC subsytem
* Grails PlugIn framewok
* Anything else...
